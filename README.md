# Clopidogrel-Model
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Clopidogrel and Its Four Relevant Metabolites for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 Drug-Drug-Gene Interaction Predictions
## Repository Files 
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of clopidogrel and its metabolites clopidogrel carboxylic acid, clopidogrel acyl glucuronide, 2-oxo-clopidogrel, as well as the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol H4. The model has been carefully developed using a large number of published clinical studies and the predictive performance of the model was evaluated within our DDI network.

The model is split into two files: 
- Clopidogrel-Model: Contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model development, including the respective observed data digitized from literature.
- Clopidogrel-CYP2C19-DGI: Contains simulations describing the effect of different CYP2C19 phenotypes on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel and clopidogrel thiol H4.
